// needed to resume the conversation — including after a reload — as a small
// localStorage table, namespaced per signed-in account since a device may hold
// sessions for more than one user over time.
//
// The backend does index which rooms each user is a participant in (see
// discoverConversations below), but only as a catch-up mechanism for a
// first-contact room opened while this device was offline — it's not a general
// "conversations" API and carries no message content.
